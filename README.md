# Business Understanding
With a growing trend towards digitisation and prevalence of mobile phones and internet access, more consumers have an online presence and their opinions hold a good value for any product-based company, especially so for the B2C businesses. The industries are trying to fine-tune their strategies to suit the consumer needs, as the consumers leave some hints of their choices during their online presence.

Whenever you are working on devising market strategies or working on product development, there are a few standard things you need to look out for that can be developed by analysing the dataset you will be working with.

1. By analysing the sentiment of the reviews, you can find the features of the phones that have resulted in positive/negative sentiments. This will help companies include or improve those particular features while developing a new product. If the data is of the competitor brands, the company will benefit by not repeating the same mistake during product development as their rival.
2. Companies can effectively design their Ad campaign by highlighting the features that are most talked about among the consumers.
3. Comparing the competitors' pricing and their market shares will help companies decide the price of their products.
4. It can be assumed that if the number of reviews for a particular brand is high, the number of people buying phones of that brand is also high. This will help companies gauge the market share of their competitors.
5. Before purchasing any product, we all look at similar products in various brands. This data will help the companies know their major competitors in the market.
